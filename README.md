EasyCRT and EasyGDI are libraries that work in Borland's early releases of
Turbo Pascal for Windows (circa 1992). I wrote them when I was a junior in my
high school, where Turbo Pascal was the main programming language used in
computer classes. EasyGDI is a procedural graphics library that wraps around
the Windows GDI (graphics device interface), providing a simplified interface
and adding new features like bitmap load and save routines. EasyCRT lets users
write graphical windows programs without dealing with complexities like
callback functions, event loops, or class libraries. It is based on Borland's
Wincrt library, and it was used by students in my class and a few classes
thereafter to write games. Both libraries come with documentation and sample
programs. They have a homepage [here](https://russ.yanofsky.org/easycrt/) and
some documentation viewable
[here](https://russ.yanofsky.org/viewvc.py/easycrt/html/main.html).
