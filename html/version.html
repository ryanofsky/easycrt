        graphics in my program he asked if I could make add some
        graphics routines to WinCRT. These were very simple and
        it was still very buggy and clumsy. There were five new
        commands: Line, Circle, Drawpicture, Setfont and Pprint.
        These commands created and deleted pens and the device
        contexts with their procedures. So the command lines were
        really long and they were slower. They were also
        unpredicatable because they completely ignored the brush.</td>

        today and was completely backwards compatible with 1.0,
        but the new inkey and inkeyasc functions were still a
        little buggy, and there was no mouse or window functions.</td>

        which would not be possible using EasyCRT. These included
        having more control over the window (always on top, no
        border, centered, etc), getting mouse input, and drawing
        in memory then copying to the screen rather than just
        drawing to screen. I also wanted to be able to use and
        learn ObjectWindows. But since I didn't want to have to
        use the GDI drawing commands I made EasyGDI. This allowed
        me to have the best of both worlds.</td>
