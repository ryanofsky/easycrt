    <td>October '97</td>
    <td>Area!</td>
    <td>1.0</td>
    <td>A computer game teaching how to find areas of circles, triangles and rectangles. This
    was where I was first figuring out the graphics commands.</td>

    <td>October '97</td>
    <td>EasyCRT </td>
    <td>1.0</td>
    <td>After my computer teacher saw the some of the graphics in my program he asked if I
    could make add some graphics routines to WinCRT. These were very simple and it was still
    very buggy and clumsy. There were five new commands: Line, Circle, Drawpicture, Setfont
    and Pprint. These commands created and deleted pens and the device contexts with their
    procedures. So the command lines were really long and they were slower. They were also
    unpredicatable because they completely ignored the brush.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>December '97</td>
    <td>EasyCRT</td>
    <td>2.0</td>
    <td>This added most of the new drawing commands in it today and was completely backwards
    compatible with 1.0, but the new inkey and inkeyasc functions were still a little buggy,
    and there was no mouse or window functions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>December '97</td>
    <td>EasyCRT</td>
    <td>2.01</td>
    <td>Fixed the inkey and inkeyasc functions. (the computer projects for my class were made
    mostly in this version.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>January '98</td>
    <td>EasyGDI</td>
    <td>1.0</td>
    <td>I wanted to give my game, Stickfighter, some features which would not be possible
    using EasyCRT. These included having more control over the window (always on top, no
    border, centered, etc), getting mouse input, and drawing in memory then copying to the
    screen rather than just drawing to screen. I also wanted to be able to use and learn
    ObjectWindows. But since I didn't want to have to use the GDI drawing commands I made
    EasyGDI. This allowed me to have the best of both worlds.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>January '98</td>
    <td>EasyCRT</td>
    <td>3.0</td>
    <td>This added mouse input, window control, and File Dialog Box, features to EasyCRT.
    However, by this time we had finished our projects it was not really used by anybody.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>March '98</td>
    <td>EasyCRT</td>
    <td>3.2</td>
    <td>This was made specifically for this Science Fair.It eliminated some of the old
    commands and made certain parts more efficient.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>November '98</td>
    <td>EasyCRT</td>
    <td>4.0</td>
    <td>This version eliminated all of the known bugs in the previous versions and added the
    ability to use colored text in the CRT window. Many of the commands have been renamed and
    redesigned so it is more efficient but no longer compabitble with older versions of
    EasyCRT.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>November '98</td>
    <td>EasyGDI</td>
    <td>2.0</td>
    <td>This version features a complete redesign of the EasyGDI interface which is faster,
    easier to use, and filled with more features.</td>
